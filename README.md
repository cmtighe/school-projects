# school-projects

These are just a few old school projects that I enjoyed writing.

passwordCracking is two simple Python scripts. One uses a brute force attack while the other is a dictionary attack based on the wordsEn.txt file. Both have the input file hard coded.

connectFour is a Haskell function that will run a 2-player ASCII game of connect four. In order to run it, first start hugs, then use :load Main.hs, then :main.

pathfinding is a Java project that uses different search algorithms to find the end of a text maze in the fastest way possible. A map of the text maze is passed as an arguement, followed by the option for which algorithm is desired.
